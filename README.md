# apm_calc

## Description
A basic python application that uses keylogging to track your Actions Per Minute (APM) by clicking a `start` and `end` button, as well as an option to save the end results to a .txt log file

## Running the Application
- Download or clone the folder to a chosen destination
- Open the folder and go into the `\dist\` folder
- Run the APMCalculator.exe to start the program.
- If you choose to save your results, the results are saved to `apm_log.txt`, which will also be in the `\dists\` folder

## Challenges
- Getting used to Python syntax (2nd project ever using Python)
- Getting libraries and modules downloaded correctly
- Understanding `pynput` (keylogging) listeners 
- Learning and understanding `tkinter` for GUI 

## Result Log
- Located in the \dist\ folder (same location as the .exe)
- Is created upon completion (should be on run, still figuring it out)

## Learned
- Basics of keylogging and key listening
- Created my first GUI application + in python
- Creating an executable program
- Better understanding of python

## Things to Improve
- Reduce amount of global variables by using dynamic variables instead
- More functions but even smaller. More control
- Reduce scope of variables and functions
- GUI interface / responsiveness
- Fix end button hang / freeze
- Add a `reset` button to rerun rather than closing and restarting program
